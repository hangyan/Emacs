;;; Commentary:

;;; This file is effectively a common-use wrapper for
;;; `sx-request-make'.  It provides higher-level handling such as
;;; (authentication, filters, ...) that `sx-request-make' doesn't need
;;; to handle.

(require 'json)
(require 'url)
(require 'sx)

  "Call METHOD with additional keys.

:ID is the id associated with a question, answer, comment, post or
user.
:SUBMETHOD is the additional segments of the method.
:KEYWORDS are the api parameters.
:FILTER is the set of filters to control the returned information
:AUTH defines how to act if the method or filters require
authentication.
:URL-METHOD is either \"POST\" or \"GET\"
:SITE is the api parameter specifying the site.

When AUTH is nil, it is assumed that no auth-requiring filters or
methods will be used.  If they are an error will be signaled.  This is
to ensure awareness of where auth is needed.

When AUTH Is t, filters will automatically use a non-auth subset if
no `access_token' is available.  Methods requiring auth will instead
use `sx-request-fallback' rather than have a failed API response.
This is meant to allow for UI pages where portions may require AUTH
but could still be used without authenticating (i.e a launch/home page).

When AUTH is 'warn, methods will signal a `user-error'.  This is meant
for interactive commands that absolutely require authentication
\(submitting questions/answers, reading inbox, etc).  Filters will
treat 'warn as equivalent to t.

Return the entire response as a complex alist."
