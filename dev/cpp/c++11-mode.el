To submit a problem report, enter `\\[c-submit-bug-report]' from a
c++-mode buffer.  This automatically sets up a mail buffer with
version information already added.  You just need to add a description
of the problem, including a reproducible test case, and send the
message.

To see what version of CC Mode you are running, enter `\\[c-version]'.

The hook `c-mode-common-hook' is run with no args at mode
initialization, then `c++-mode-hook'.
